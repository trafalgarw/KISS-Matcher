\*\* PLEASE READ AND DELETE MY MESSAGE\*\*

Hi, this is Hyungtae, the first author of KISS-Matcher. I appreciate you visiting our Github issue. I always want to help you as much as I can; however, due to my limited time for research, I may not be able to thoroughly address every issue. I kindly ask for your understanding.

For everyone’s benefit, please make your questions **as detailed as possible**. Please avoid very short, one-line questions, because they often require multiple follow-up inquiries for clarification, which can be time-consuming and stressful.

To ensure smoother communication, kindly include **as many relevant details as** you can when submitting your issue. Thank you for your cooperation.

## In sum, Please avoid the following when submitting an issue:

### Bad case A. One-line or vague questions

Example: "It doesn't work. What should I do?"
Instead, provide details such as error messages, steps to reproduce, system specifications, and expected vs. actual behavior.

### Bad case B. Requesting general debugging without context

Example: "Can you check my code?" without explaining the problem, expected outcome, or attempted solutions.

### Bad case C. Posting duplicate issues

Before submitting, check if a similar issue has already been raised and addressed.

### Bad case D. Unrelated questions

## Please keep issues relevant to KISS-Matcher. For general research questions, consider other forums such as Stack Overflow or related academic discussions.
