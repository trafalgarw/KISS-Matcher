    keyframe:
      keyframe_threshold: 1.5        # ⭐ [Unit: m] Distance threshold to add a new keyframe
      # NOTE(hlim): Once `num_submap_keyframes` is larger than 1,
      # Submap-to-submap registration is performed.
      # The main advantage of KISS-Matcher is its super-fast speed in submap matching!

      # If true, Z-axis differences are considered in loop detection.
      # If false, loop detection assumes the robot moves mainly on a single horizontal plane.
      is_multilayer_env: false                # ⭐ Whether the robot operates in a multilayer environment
      # NOTE(hlim): You may need to tune `loop_detection_radius` and `loop_detection_timediff_threshold` for your environment
      # after checking the Loop closure radius marker in Rviz.

      # NOTE(hlim): The best value of `overlap_threshold` highly depends on `num_submap_keyframes`
      # Thus, heuristic tuning is required for the best performance.
